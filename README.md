# kcm-rss-feed

## Instructions

Using vanilla Javascript or Javascript plus any framework you choose (other than jQuery), create a simple
app that accepts one input for an RSS feed URL and presents a visual list of the blog posts within that
RSS feed.
Use this feed URL for testing: https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/en/feed/?a=186161-a1b0b6b3364ed92fe215bff8a46af47a
For each item in the list, make sure to display the following:
- Featured image
- Title
- Date published
- Excerpt
- Button to read the full post
The button to read the full post should hide the list of all posts and display the full version of whichever
post was chosen along with a button to go back to the list.
